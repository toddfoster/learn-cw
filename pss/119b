25	My soul cleaves to the dust; *
give me life according to your word.
26	I have confessed my ways, and you answered me; *
instruct me in your statutes.

that I may meditate on your marvelous works.
28	My soul melts away for sorrow; *

29	Take from me the way of lying; *
let me find grace through your law.
30	I have chosen the way of faithfulness; *
I have set your judgments before me.
31	I hold fast to your decrees; *
O LORD, let me not be put to shame.
32	I will run the way of your commandments, *
for you have set my heart at liberty.

which you make to those who fear you.

in your righteousness preserve my life.

41	Let your loving-kindness come to me, O LORD, *
and your salvation, according to your promise.
42	Then shall I have a word for those who taunt me, *
because I trust in your words.
43	Do not take the word of truth out of my mouth, *
for my hope is in your judgments.
44	I shall continue to keep your law; *
I shall keep it for ever and ever.
45	I will walk at liberty, *
because I study your commandments.
46	I will tell of your decrees before kings *
and will not be ashamed.
47	I delight in your commandments, *
which I have always loved.
48	I will lift up my hands to your commandments, *
and I will meditate on your statutes.
