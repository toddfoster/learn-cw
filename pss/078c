Part II
Quoties exacerbaverunt
40	How often the people disobeyed him in the wilderness *
and offended him in the desert!
41	Again and again they tempted God *
and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
42	They did not remember his power *
in the day when he ransomed them from the enemy;
43	How he wrought his signs in Egypt *
and his omens in the field of Zoan.
44	He turned their rivers into blood, *
so that they could not drink of their streams.
45	He sent swarms of flies among them, which ate them up, *
and frogs, which destroyed them.
46	He gave their crops to the caterpillar, *
the fruit of their toil to the locust.
47	He killed their vines with hail *
and their sycamores with frost.
48	He delivered their cattle to hailstones *
and their livestock to hot thunderbolts.
49	He poured out upon them his blazing anger: *
fury, indignation, and distress,
a troop of destroying angels.
50	He gave full rein to his anger;
he did not spare their souls from death; *
but delivered their lives to the plague.
51	He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, *
the flower of manhood in the dwellings of Ham.
52	He led out his people like sheep *
and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
53	He led them to safety, and they were not afraid; *
but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
54	He brought them to his holy land, *
the mountain his right hand had won.
55	He drove out the Canaanites before them
and apportioned an inheritance to them by lot; *
he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
