Benedic, anima mea
1	Bless the LORD, O my soul; *
O LORD my God, how excellent is your greatness!
you are clothed with majesty and splendor.
2	You wrap yourself with light as with a cloak *
and spread out the heavens like a curtain.
3	You lay the beams of your chambers in the waters above; *
you make the clouds your chariot;
you ride on the wings of the wind.
4	You make the winds your messengers *
and flames of fire your servants.
5	You have set the earth upon its foundations, *
so that it never shall move at any time.
6	You covered it with the Deep as with a mantle; *
the waters stood higher than the mountains.
7	At your rebuke they fled; *
at the voice of your thunder they hastened away.
8	They went up into the hills and down to the valleys beneath, *
to the places you had appointed for them.
9	You set the limits that they should not pass; *
they shall not again cover the earth.
10	You send the springs into the valleys; *
they flow between the mountains.
11	All the beasts of the field drink their fill from them, *
and the wild asses quench their thirst.
12	Beside them the birds of the air make their nests *
and sing among the branches.
13	You water the mountains from your dwelling on high; *
the earth is fully satisfied by the fruit of your works.
14	You make grass grow for flocks and herds *
and plants to serve mankind;
15	That they may bring forth food from the earth, *
and wine to gladden our hearts,
16	Oil to make a cheerful countenance, *
and bread to strengthen the heart.
17	The trees of the LORD are full of sap, *
the cedars of Lebanon which he planted,
18	In which the birds build their nests, *
and in whose tops the stork makes his dwelling.
