Part I
Attendite, popule
1	Hear my teaching, O my people; *
incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
2	I will open my mouth in a parable; *
I will declare the mysteries of ancient times.
3	That which we have heard and known,
and what our forefathers have told us, *
we will not hide from their children.
4	We will recount to generations to come
the praiseworthy deeds and the power of the LORD, *
and the wonderful works he has done.
5	He gave his decrees to Jacob
and established a law for Israel, *
which he commanded them to teach their children;
6	That the generations to come might know,
and the children yet unborn; *
that they in their turn might tell it to their children;
7	So that they might put their trust in God, *
and not forget the deeds of God,
but keep his commandments;
8	And not be like their forefathers,
a stubborn and rebellious generation, *
a generation whose heart was not steadfast,
and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
9	The people of Ephraim, armed with the bow, *
turned back in the day of battle;
10	They did not keep the covenant of God, *
and refused to walk in his law;
11	They forgot what he had done, *
and the wonders he had shown them.
12	He worked marvels in the sight of their forefathers, *
in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
13	He split open the sea and let them pass through; *
he made the waters stand up like walls.
14	He led them with a cloud by day, *
and all the night through with a glow of fire.
15	He split the hard rocks in the wilderness *
and gave them drink as from the great deep.
16	He brought streams out of the cliff, *
and the waters gushed out like rivers.
