Yodh
Manus tuœ fecerunt me
73	Your hands have made me and fashioned me; *
give me understanding, that I may learn your commandments.
74	Those who fear you will be glad when they see me, *
because I trust in your word.
75	I know, O LORD, that your judgments are right *
and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.
76	Let your loving-kindness be my comfort, *
as you have promised to your servant.
77	Let your compassion come to me, that I may live, *
for your law is my delight.
78	Let the arrogant be put to shame, for they wrong me with lies; *
but I will meditate on your commandments.
79	Let those who fear you turn to me, *
and also those who know your decrees.
80	Let my heart be sound in your statutes, *
that I may not be put to shame.
Kaph
Defecit in salutare
81	My soul has longed for your salvation; *
I have put my hope in your word.
82	My eyes have failed from watching for your promise, *
and I say, "When will you comfort me?"
83	I have become like a leather flask in the smoke, *
but I have not forgotten your statutes.
84	How much longer must I wait? *
when will you give judgment against those who persecute me?
85	The proud have dug pits for me; *
they do not keep your law.
86	All your commandments are true; *
help me, for they persecute me with lies.
87	They had almost made an end of me on earth, *
but I have not forsaken your commandments.
88	In your loving-kindness, revive me, *
that I may keep the decrees of your mouth.

Lamedh
In œternum, Domine
89	O LORD, your word is everlasting; *
it stands firm in the heavens.
90	Your faithfulness remains from one generation to another; *
you established the earth, and it abides.
91	By your decree these continue to this day, *
for all things are your servants.
92	If my delight had not been in your law, *
I should have perished in my affliction.
93	I will never forget your commandments, *
because by them you give me life.
94	I am yours; oh, that you would save me! *
for I study your commandments.
95	Though the wicked lie in wait for me to destroy me, *
I will apply my mind to your decrees.
96	I see that all things come to an end, *
but your commandment has no bounds.
