Memor esto verbi tui
49	Remember your word to your servant, *
because you have given me hope.
50	This is my comfort in my trouble, *
that your promise gives me life.
51	The proud have derided me cruelly, *
but I have not turned from your law.
52	When I remember your judgments of old, *
O LORD, I take great comfort.
53	I am filled with a burning rage, *
because of the wicked who forsake your law.
54	Your statutes have been like songs to me *
wherever I have lived as a stranger.
55	I remember your Name in the night, O LORD, *
and dwell upon your law.
56	This is how it has been with me, *
because I have kept your commandments.

Heth
Portio mea, Domine
57	You only are my portion, O LORD; *
I have promised to keep your words.
58	I entreat you with all my heart, *
be merciful to me according to your promise.
59	I have considered my ways *
and turned my feet toward your decrees.
60	I hasten and do not tarry *
to keep your commandments.
61	Though the cords of the wicked entangle me, *
I do not forget your law.
62	At midnight I will rise to give you thanks, *
because of your righteous judgments.
63	I am a companion of all who fear you *
and of those who keep your commandments.
64	The earth, O LORD, is full of your love; *
instruct me in your statutes.

Teth
Bonitatem fecisti
65	O LORD, you have dealt graciously with your servant, *
according to your word.
66	Teach me discernment and knowledge, *
for I have believed in your commandments.
67	Before I was afflicted I went astray, *
but now I keep your word.
68	You are good and you bring forth good; *
instruct me in your statutes.
69	The proud have smeared me with lies, *
but I will keep your commandments with my whole heart.
70	Their heart is gross and fat, *
but my delight is in your law.
71	It is good for me that I have been afflicted, *
that I might learn your statutes.
72	The law of your mouth is dearer to me *
than thousands in gold and silver.
