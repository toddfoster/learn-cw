17	But they went on sinning against him, *
rebelling in the desert against the Most High.
18	They tested God in their hearts, *
demanding food for their craving.
19	They railed against God and said, *
"Can God set a table in the wilderness?
20	True, he struck the rock, the waters gushed out, and the gullies overflowed; *
but is he able to give bread
or to provide meat for his people?"
21	When the LORD heard this, he was full of wrath; *
a fire was kindled against Jacob,
and his anger mounted against Israel;
22	For they had no faith in God, *
nor did they put their trust in his saving power.
23	So he commanded the clouds above *
and opened the doors of heaven.
24	He rained down manna upon them to eat *
and gave them grain from heaven.
25	So mortals ate the bread of angels; *
he provided for them food enough.
26	He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens *
and led out the south wind by his might.
27	He rained down flesh upon them like dust *
and wing√®d birds like the sand of the sea.
28	He let it fall in the midst of their camp *
and round about their dwellings.
29	So they ate and were well filled, *
for he gave them what they craved.
30	But they did not stop their craving, *
though the food was still in their mouths.
31	So God's anger mounted against them; *
he slew their strongest men
and laid low the youth of Israel.
32	In spite of all this, they went on sinning *
and had no faith in his wonderful works.
33	So he brought their days to an end like a breath *
and their years in sudden terror.
34	Whenever he slew them, they would seek him, *
and repent, and diligently search for God.
35	They would remember that God was their rock, *
and the Most High God their redeemer.
36	But they flattered him with their mouths *
and lied to him with their tongues.
37	Their heart was not steadfast toward him, *
and they were not faithful to his covenant.
38	But he was so merciful that he forgave their sins
and did not destroy them; *
many times he held back his anger
and did not permit his wrath to be roused.
39	For he remembered that they were but flesh, *
a breath that goes forth and does not return.
