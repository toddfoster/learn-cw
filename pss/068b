19	Blessed be the Lord day by day, *
the God of our salvation, who bears our burdens.
20	He is our God, the God of our salvation; *
God is the LORD, by whom we escape death.
21	God shall crush the heads of his enemies, *
and the hairy scalp of those who go on still in their wickedness.
22	The Lord has said, "I will bring them back from Bashan; *
I will bring them back from the depths of the sea;
23	That your foot may be dipped in blood, *
the tongues of your dogs in the blood of your enemies."
24	They see your procession, O God, *
your procession into the sanctuary, my God and my King.
25	The singers go before, musicians follow after, *
in the midst of maidens playing upon the hand-drums.
26	Bless God in the congregation; *
bless the LORD, you that are of the fountain of Israel.
27	There is Benjamin, least of the tribes, at the head;
the princes of Judah in a company; *
and the princes of Zebulon and Naphtali.
28	Send forth your strength, O God; *
establish, O God, what you have wrought for us.
29	Kings shall bring gifts to you, *
for your temple's sake at Jerusalem.
30	Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, *
and the peoples, a herd of wild bulls with its calves.
31	Trample down those who lust after silver; *
scatter the peoples that delight in war.
32	Let tribute be brought out of Egypt; *
let Ethiopia stretch out her hands to God.
33	Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; *
sing praises to the Lord.
34	He rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens; *
he sends forth his voice, his mighty voice.
35	Ascribe power to God; *
his majesty is over Israel;
his strength is in the skies.
36	How wonderful is God in his holy places! *
the God of Israel giving strength and power to his people!
Blessed be God!
