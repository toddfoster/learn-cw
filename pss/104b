19	The high hills are a refuge for the mountain goats, *
and the stony cliffs for the rock badgers.
20	You appointed the moon to mark the seasons, *
and the sun knows the time of its setting.
21	You make darkness that it may be night, *
in which all the beasts of the forest prowl.
22	The lions roar after their prey *
and seek their food from God.
23	The sun rises, and they slip away *
and lay themselves down in their dens.
24	Man goes forth to his work *
and to his labor until the evening.
25	O LORD, how manifold are your works! *
in wisdom you have made them all;
the earth is full of your creatures.
26	Yonder is the great and wide sea
with its living things too many to number, *
creatures both small and great.
27	There move the ships,
and there is that Leviathan, *
which you have made for the sport of it.
28	All of them look to you *
to give them their food in due season.
29	You give it to them; they gather it; *
you open your hand, and they are filled with good things.
30	You hide your face, and they are terrified; *
you take away their breath,
and they die and return to their dust.
31	You send forth your Spirit, and they are created; *
and so you renew the face of the earth.
32	May the glory of the LORD endure for ever; *
may the LORD rejoice in all his works.
33	He looks at the earth and it trembles; *
he touches the mountains and they smoke.
34	I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; *
I will praise my God while I have my being.
35	May these words of mine please him; *
I will rejoice in the LORD.
36	Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, *
and the wicked be no more.
37	Bless the LORD, O my soul. *
Hallelujah!
