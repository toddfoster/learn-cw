Aleph
Beati immaculati
1	Happy are they whose way is blameless, *
who walk in the law of the LORD!
2	Happy are they who observe his decrees *
and seek him with all their hearts!
3	Who never do any wrong, *
but always walk in his ways.
4	You laid down your commandments, *
that we should fully keep them.
5	Oh, that my ways were made so direct *
that I might keep your statutes!
6	Then I should not be put to shame, *
when I regard all your commandments.
7	I will thank you with an unfeigned heart, *
when I have learned your righteous judgments.
8	I will keep your statutes; *
do not utterly forsake me.

Beth
In quo corrigit?
9	How shall a young man cleanse his way? *
By keeping to your words.
10	With my whole heart I seek you; *
let me not stray from your commandments.
11	I treasure your promise in my heart, *
that I may not sin against you.
12	Blessed are you, O LORD; *
instruct me in your statutes.
13	With my lips will I recite *
all the judgments of your mouth.
14	I have taken greater delight in the way of your decrees *
than in all manner of riches.
15	I will meditate on your commandments *
and give attention to your ways.
16	My delight is in your statutes; *
I will not forget your word.

Gimel
Retribue servo tuo
17	Deal bountifully with your servant, *
that I may live and keep your word.
18	Open my eyes, that I may see *
the wonders of your law.
19	I am a stranger here on earth; *
do not hide your commandments from me.
20	My soul is consumed at all times *
with longing for your judgments.
21	You have rebuked the insolent; *
cursed are they who stray from your commandments!
22	Turn from me shame and rebuke, *
for I have kept your decrees.
23	Even though rulers sit and plot against me, *
I will meditate on your statutes.
24	For your decrees are my delight, *
and they are my counselors.
