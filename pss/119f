Ayin
Feci judicium
121	I have done what is just and right; *
do not deliver me to my oppressors.
122	Be surety for your servant's good; *
let not the proud oppress me.
123	My eyes have failed from watching for your salvation *
and for your righteous promise.
124	Deal with your servant according to your loving-kindness *
and teach me your statutes.
125	I am your servant; grant me understanding, *
that I may know your decrees.
126	It is time for you to act, O LORD, *
for they have broken your law.
127	Truly, I love your commandments *
more than gold and precious stones.
128	I hold all your commandments to be right for me; *
all paths of falsehood I abhor.

Pe
Mirabilia
129	Your decrees are wonderful; *
therefore I obey them with all my heart.
130	When your word goes forth it gives light; *
it gives understanding to the simple.
131	I open my mouth and pant; *
I long for your commandments.
132	Turn to me in mercy, *
as you always do to those who love your Name.
133	Steady my footsteps in your word; *
let no iniquity have dominion over me.
134	Rescue me from those who oppress me, *
and I will keep your commandments.
135	Let your countenance shine upon your servant *
and teach me your statutes.
136	My eyes shed streams of tears, *
because people do not keep your law.

Sadhe
Justus es, Domine
137	You are righteous, O LORD, *
and upright are your judgments.
138	You have issued your decrees *
with justice and in perfect faithfulness.
139	My indignation has consumed me, *
because my enemies forget your words.
140	Your word has been tested to the uttermost, *
and your servant holds it dear.
141	I am small and of little account, *
yet I do not forget your commandments.
142	Your justice is an everlasting justice *
and your law is the truth.
143	Trouble and distress have come upon me, *
yet your commandments are my delight.
144	The righteousness of your decrees is everlasting; *
grant me understanding, that I may live.
