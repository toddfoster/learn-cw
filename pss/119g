oh, that you would save me! *
I will keep your decrees.
147	Early in the morning I cry out to you, *
for in your word is my trust.
148	My eyes are open in the night watches, *
that I may meditate upon your promise.
149	Hear my voice, O LORD, according to your loving-kindness; *
according to your judgments, give me life.
150	They draw near who in malice persecute me; *
they are very far from your law.
151	You, O LORD, are near at hand, *
and all your commandments are true.
152	Long have I known from your decrees *
that you have established them for ever.

for they do not study your statutes.
156	Great is your compassion, O LORD; *
preserve my life, according to your judgments.
157	There are many who persecute and oppress me, *
yet I have not swerved from your decrees.
158	I look with loathing at the faithless, *
for they have not kept your word.
159	See how I love your commandments! *
O LORD, in your mercy, preserve me.
160	The heart of your word is truth; *
all your righteous judgments endure for evermore.

Principes persecuti sunt
161	Rulers have persecuted me without a cause, *
but my heart stands in awe of your word.
162	I am as glad because of your promise *
as one who finds great spoils.
163	As for lies, I hate and abhor them, *
but your law is my love.
164	Seven times a day do I praise you, *
because of your righteous judgments.
165	Great peace have they who love your law; *
for them there is no stumbling block.
166	I have hoped for your salvation, O LORD, *
and have fulfilled your commandments.
167	I have kept your decrees *
and I have loved them deeply.
168	I have kept your commandments and decrees, *
for all my ways are before you.

Appropinquet deprecatio
169	Let my cry come before you, O LORD; *
give me understanding, according to your word.
170	Let my supplication come before you; *
deliver me, according to your promise.
171	My lips shall pour forth your praise, *
when you teach me your statutes.
172	My tongue shall sing of your promise, *
for all your commandments are righteous.
173	Let your hand be ready to help me, *
for I have chosen your commandments.
174	I long for your salvation, O LORD, *
and your law is my delight.
175	Let me live, and I will praise you, *
and let your judgments help me.
176	I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost; *
search for your servant,
for I do not forget your commandments.
