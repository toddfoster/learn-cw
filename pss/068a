Exsurgat Deus
1	Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; *
let those who hate him flee before him.
2	Let them vanish like smoke when the wind drives it away; *
as the wax melts at the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
3	But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; *
let them also be merry and joyful.
4	Sing to God, sing praises to his Name;
exalt him who rides upon the heavens; *
YAHWEH is his Name, rejoice before him!
5	Father of orphans, defender of widows, *
God in his holy habitation!
6	God gives the solitary a home and brings forth prisoners
into freedom; *
but the rebels shall live in dry places.
7	O God, when you went forth before your people, *
when you marched through the wilderness,
8	The earth shook, and the skies poured down rain,
at the presence of God, the God of Sinai, *
at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
9	You sent a gracious rain, O God, upon your inheritance; *
you refreshed the land when it was weary.
10	Your people found their home in it; *
in your goodness, O God, you have made provision for the poor.
11	The Lord gave the word; *
great was the company of women who bore the tidings:
12	"Kings with their armies are fleeing away; *
the women at home are dividing the spoils."
13	Though you lingered among the sheepfolds, *
you shall be like a dove whose wings are covered with silver,
whose feathers are like green gold.
14	When the Almighty scattered kings, *
it was like snow falling in Zalmon.
15	O mighty mountain, O hill of Bashan! *
O rugged mountain, O hill of Bashan!
16	Why do you look with envy, O rugged mountain,
at the hill which God chose for his resting place? *
truly, the LORD will dwell there for ever.
17	The chariots of God are twenty thousand,
even thousands of thousands; *
the Lord comes in holiness from Sinai.
18	You have gone up on high and led captivity captive;
you have received gifts even from your enemies, *
that the LORD God might dwell among them.
