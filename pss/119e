Mem
Quomodo dilexi!
97	Oh, how I love your law! *
all the day long it is in my mind.
98	Your commandment has made me wiser than my enemies, *
and it is always with me.
99	I have more understanding than all my teachers, *
for your decrees are my study.
100	I am wiser than the elders, *
because I observe your commandments.
101	I restrain my feet from every evil way, *
that I may keep your word.
102	I do not shrink from your judgments, *
because you yourself have taught me.
103	How sweet are your words to my taste! *
they are sweeter than honey to my mouth.
104	Through your commandments I gain understanding; *
therefore I hate every lying way.

Nun
Lucerna pedibus meis
105	Your word is a lantern to my feet *
and a light upon my path.
106	I have sworn and am determined *
to keep your righteous judgments.
107	I am deeply troubled; *
preserve my life, O LORD, according to your word.
108	Accept, O LORD, the willing tribute of my lips, *
and teach me your judgments.
109	My life is always in my hand, *
yet I do not forget your law.
110	The wicked have set a trap for me, *
but I have not strayed from your commandments.
111	Your decrees are my inheritance for ever; *
truly, they are the joy of my heart.
112	I have applied my heart to fulfill your statutes *
for ever and to the end.

Samekh
Iniquos odio habui
113	I hate those who have a divided heart, *
but your law do I love.
114	You are my refuge and shield; *
my hope is in your word.
115	Away from me, you wicked! *
I will keep the commandments of my God.
116	Sustain me according to your promise, that I may live, *
and let me not be disappointed in my hope.
117	Hold me up, and I shall be safe, *
and my delight shall be ever in your statutes.
118	You spurn all who stray from your statutes; *
their deceitfulness is in vain.
119	In your sight all the wicked of the earth are but dross; *
therefore I love your decrees.
120	My flesh trembles with dread of you; *
I am afraid of your judgments.
