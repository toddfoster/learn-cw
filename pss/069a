Salvum me fac
1	Save me, O God, *
for the waters have risen up to my neck.
2	I am sinking in deep mire, *
and there is no firm ground for my feet.
3	I have come into deep waters, *
and the torrent washes over me.
4	I have grown weary with my crying;
my throat is inflamed; *
my eyes have failed from looking for my God.
5	Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head;
my lying foes who would destroy me are mighty. *
Must I then give back what I never stole?
6	O God, you know my foolishness, *
and my faults are not hidden from you.
7	Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me,
Lord GOD of hosts; *
let not those who seek you be disgraced because of me,
O God of Israel.
8	Surely, for your sake have I suffered reproach, *
and shame has covered my face.
9	I have become a stranger to my own kindred, *
an alien to my mother's children.
10	Zeal for your house has eaten me up; *
the scorn of those who scorn you has fallen upon me.
11	I humbled myself with fasting, *
but that was turned to my reproach.
12	I put on sack-cloth also, *
and became a byword among them.
13	Those who sit at the gate murmur against me, *
and the drunkards make songs about me.
14	But as for me, this is my prayer to you, *
at the time you have set, O LORD:
15	"In your great mercy, O God, *
answer me with your unfailing help.
16	Save me from the mire; do not let me sink; *
let me be rescued from those who hate me
and out of the deep waters.
17	Let not the torrent of waters wash over me,
neither let the deep swallow me up; *
do not let the Pit shut its mouth upon me.
