56	But they tested the Most High God, and defied him, *
and did not keep his commandments.
57	They turned away and were disloyal like their fathers; *
they were undependable like a warped bow.
58	They grieved him with their hill-altars *
they provoked his displeasure with their idols.
59	When God heard this, he was angry *
and utterly rejected Israel.
60	He forsook the shrine at Shiloh, *
the tabernacle where he had lived among his people.
61	He delivered the ark into captivity, *
his glory into the adversary's hand.
62	He gave his people to the sword *
and was angered against his inheritance.
63	The fire consumed their young men; *
there were no wedding songs for their maidens.
64	Their priests fell by the sword, *
and their widows made no lamentation.
65	Then the LORD woke as though from sleep, *
like a warrior refreshed with wine.
66	He struck his enemies on the backside *
and put them to perpetual shame.
67	He rejected the tent of Joseph *
and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
68	He chose instead the tribe of Judah *
and Mount Zion, which he loved.
69	He built his sanctuary like the heights of heaven, *
like the earth which he founded for ever.
70	He chose David his servant, *
and took him away from the sheepfolds.
71	He brought him from following the ewes, *
to be a shepherd over Jacob his people
and over Israel his inheritance.
72	So he shepherded them with a faithful and true heart *
and guided them with the skillfulness of his hands.
