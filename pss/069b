18	Answer me, O LORD, for your love is kind; *
in your great compassion, turn to me."
19	"Hide not your face from your servant; *
be swift and answer me, for I am in distress.
20	Draw near to me and redeem me; *
because of my enemies deliver me.
21	You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor; *
my adversaries are all in your sight."
22	Reproach has broken my heart, and it cannot be healed; *
I looked for sympathy, but there was none,
for comforters, but I could find no one.
23	They gave me gall to eat, *
and when I was thirsty, they gave me vinegar to drink.
24	Let the table before them be a trap *
and their sacred feasts a snare.
25	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, *
and give them continual trembling in their loins.
26	Pour out your indignation upon them, *
and let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.
27	Let their camp be desolate, *
and let there be none to dwell in their tents.
28	For they persecute him whom you have stricken *
and add to the pain of those whom you have pierced.
29	Lay to their charge guilt upon guilt, *
and let them not receive your vindication.
30	Let them be wiped out of the book of the living *
and not be written among the righteous.
31	As for me, I am afflicted and in pain; *
your help, O God, will lift me up on high.
32	I will praise the Name of God in song; *
I will proclaim his greatness with thanksgiving.
33	This will please the LORD more than an offering of oxen, *
more than bullocks with horns and hoofs.
34	The afflicted shall see and be glad; *
you who seek God, your heart shall live.
35	For the LORD listens to the needy, *
and his prisoners he does not despise.
36	Let the heavens and the earth praise him, *
the seas and all that moves in them;
37	For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah; *
they shall live there and have it in possession.
38	The children of his servants will inherit it, *
and those who love his Name will dwell therein.
