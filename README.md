# learn-cw
Simple tools for learning cw. A couple of bash scripts I found useful. They rely on `cwwav`, which I believe was available to me to install from the debian/ubuntu repo's. 

`mkcw` will take a text file and render an mp3 file in Morse Code. The speed is hard-coded in the script, easy to change for your preferred default. 

`mkcwpss` will take a directory of files and render them in Morse Code. If FARNSWORTH and MAXFARNSWORTH differ, each week FARNSWORTH will be incremented until you reach MAXFARNSWORTH. 

`pss` contains the Psalms as found in the [1979 Book of Common Prayer](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/book-of-common-prayer-2006.pdf) used by [The Episcopal Church](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/).
